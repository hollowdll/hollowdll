### Juuso Hakala

Software Developer, Programmer and IT student specializing in backend development. I like to use the command line and write code in NeoVim.

I built HakjDB, my own in-memory key-value data store in Go. Repository [here](https://github.com/hollowdll/hakjdb). Blog post [here](https://juusohakala.com/blog/hakjdb-development/).
